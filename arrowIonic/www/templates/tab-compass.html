<!--using 'ion-pane' instead of ion-content is one way to disable scroll in the compass view -->
  <ion-pane>
<!--     <div>{{markerPosition}}</div>
    <div>here: {{here}}</div>
    <div>there: {{there}}</div>
    <div>bearing: {{bearing}}</div>
    <div>heading: {{heading}}</div> -->
    <div id="circle" style={{rotation}}>
      <div id="arrow"></div>
    </div>
  </ion-pane>
</ion-view>


<!-- notes to self : there are two ways of disabling scroll i see so far: 
	1. change ion-content to ion-pane (seems like the less hacky way) but if you want to scroll sometimes or in some places, etc you need to use way 2
	2. create an invisible input/button (can't just be a div) and use ng-click directive (in browser view this doesn't ever have to be clicked in order to take effect) 

		html: 
			<ion-content delegate-handle="mainScroll">
	 		 <input ng-click="stopScroll()"></input>

	 	controller js: (obvi - in controller that controls the view you want to stop scroll in)
		 	$scope.stopScroll = function() {
	    	$ionicScrollDelegate.$getByHandle('mainScroll').getScrollView().options.scrollingY = false; 
	  	}

	  Option 2 feels incredibly hacky but it doesn't freeze scroll unless there is an element on the 'page' view you want to freeze ~ ionic bug perhaps 
	  I am going with ion-pane because that is perfectly fine in this case -->
